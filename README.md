environment to the people in a highly secure way.
## Descriptionoyddpu
Open wallet currently have three layers of technology to make the user experience a lot better and we  have a lot of others in roadmap

4. NuCypher - NuCypher's superior proxy rencryption to send extra data of transaction in secure and decentralized manner.
5. Torus( or Shamir's algorithm) - To have truly secure and decentralized way to safe guard keys without having users to worry about them.

## Features
- [x] Transacting/Sending Stable coins with Phone Number in a secure manner instead of using complex addresses.
- [x] Support for fast side chain(Matic) to make transactions safer and faster.
